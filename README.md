# private-browser

### Purpose:
To create an app that servers as a hub for all your alt accounts for popular websites (instagram, reddit, etc).

This app will of course be password protected, and ideally will have a kill switch on a remote server that one can access and corrupt the app on their machine.

Just to be clear, these are just ideas right now, I've not done the sufficient research to ensure that this idea is even possible.

**Diffentiating factor(s):** 
- not forced to use another browser for your alt account browsing

So right now, the over-arching goals are:

**Purely functional:**
- [ ] ensure that the app functions regularly as a chrome browser
- [ ] able to stay signed in always
- [ ] new tabs insted of new window(s)
